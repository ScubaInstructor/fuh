### Flask Server

Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and set values to your liking.

Run `python  user_creator.py {username} {password}` in this folder to create a user and add it to the userdatabase. After that there should be a database `instance/users.db` inside the folder where this script and the server is located. 

Start server with `python akins_verbesserter_flask_server.py`.
